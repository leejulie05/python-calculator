# Hi, I'm leejulie05 👋

### 👩‍💻 About Me
I'm a student currently learning Python and exploring how to build practical applications.  
My very first project is a simple four-function calculator!

### 🛠️ My First Project: Fourcal Calculator

- **Language:** Python
- **Core files:**  
  - `calc.py`: Implements `add`, `sub`, `mul`, and `div` operations as a class.  
    - Division by zero raises a custom `DivisionError`.
  - `main.py`: Handles user input, gracefully prompts for new numbers if division by zero occurs, and lets you quit anytime by pressing `q`.
- **Features:**  
  - Clean class-based design  
  - Exception handling for division  
  - Simple, interactive CLI usage

> Press `q` to exit the calculator at any time!

### 📚 Goals
I'm excited to keep learning and try out new Python projects.  
Feel free to check out my code and share feedback!
